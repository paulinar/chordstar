CHORDSTARS
==========

Check Github Issues to find things to work on.  I'm not going to assign things to people, please just take them and self-assign ones you are working on.  Also please tag whatever you're doing appropriately.

PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN BRANCHES WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON STUFF.  ALSO DON'T EVER PUSH TO MASTER.  OPEN PULL REQUESTS AND I CAN REVIEW AND APPROVE THEM OR SOMETHING.  I DON'T WANT EVERYTHING TO BREAK BECAUSE SOMEONE FORCE PUSHED TO MASTER OR SOMETHING!!
